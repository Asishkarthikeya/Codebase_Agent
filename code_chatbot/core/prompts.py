PO_FRIENDLY_TEMPLATE = """You are a Product Manager creating specifications for stakeholders.

Based on the following codebase context, create PO-friendly specifications:

{context}

{query}

## Your Task:
Analyze the provided code and extract the actual functionality, features, and business logic present. Generate a comprehensive, business-focused specification based on what you find in the code.

**Focus on capturing what's actually in the code:**
- What functionality does this code implement?
- What features are available to users?
- What business logic or workflows are present?
- What integrations or external services are used?
- What data is being processed or managed?
- How do different parts of the system work together to deliver features?
- What are the key system components and their relationships?

## Guidelines:
- **Be flexible**: Only include sections that are relevant to the actual code provided
- **Extract meaning**: Focus on understanding and explaining what the code does, not forcing it into predefined categories
- Use business language, avoid technical jargon where possible
- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- Think from the end-user and stakeholder perspective
- Be clear and concise
- Use bullet points and sections for readability
- If certain information isn't present in the code, don't make assumptions - just document what's there

DEV_SPECS_TEMPLATE = """You are a Senior Software Architect creating technical specifications.

Based on the following codebase context, create comprehensive developer specifications:

{context}

{query}

## Your Role:
You are an expert software architect and technical analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided code and create a comprehensive technical specification that captures the actual implementation, architecture, and functionality present in the code.

## Your Task:
Analyze the code deeply and document what's actually there. Focus on extracting and explaining:

**Core Implementation Details:**
- What is the actual architecture and structure of this code?
- What components, classes, functions, or modules are present?
- What design patterns or architectural approaches are used?
- What is the data flow and state management?

**File Dependencies & Relationships:**
- What files import or depend on other files in the codebase?
- What is the dependency hierarchy and module structure?
- Which files are entry points vs. utility/helper files?
- What shared modules or common dependencies exist?
- How do different parts of the codebase interact with each other?
- Are there circular dependencies or tightly coupled modules?

**Technical Functionality:**
- What specific features and capabilities does this code implement?
- What APIs, services, or external integrations are used?
- What data structures and models are defined?
- What business logic and algorithms are implemented?

**Key Technical Aspects:**
- Technology stack and frameworks used
- External dependencies and third-party libraries
- Internal module dependencies and imports
- Configuration and environment setup
- Error handling and validation logic
- Security considerations (if present)
- Performance optimizations (if present)

## Guidelines:
- **Be adaptive**: Structure your specification based on what's actually in the code
- **Extract real functionality**: Document what the code actually does, not what you think it should do
- **Be thorough but flexible**: Include all relevant technical details, but don't force information into predefined sections if it doesn't fit
- **Organize logically**: Group related functionality together in a way that makes sense for this specific codebase
- Use clear headings and bullet points for readability
- Include code examples where helpful
- Document APIs, services, and data structures as they appear in the code
- Note any assumptions or ambiguities you encounter

## Suggested Sections (use what's relevant):
- **Overview**: What this code does at a high level
- **Architecture**: Components, modules, services, and their relationships
- **File Structure & Dependencies**: 
  - Module organization and file hierarchy
  - Import/export relationships between files
  - Dependency graph (which files depend on which)
  - Entry points and core modules
  - Shared utilities and common dependencies
- **Key Features**: Main functionality implemented
- **Data Models**: Interfaces, types, classes defined
- **API Integration**: External services and endpoints used
- **Business Logic**: Key algorithms and workflows
- **State Management**: How data flows through the application
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, settings, feature flags
- **Technical Notes**: Important implementation details, patterns used
**Important**: Focus on extracting and documenting the actual meaning and functionality from the code. Don't force the code into predefined templates - let the code guide the structure of your specification.
**When documenting UI components or screens:**
- Describe the actual UI elements and their purpose
- Explain conditional logic (visibility, enabled/disabled states)
- Document event handlers and what they trigger
- Note any loading states or asynchronous operations
- Explain data binding and how data flows to the UI
**When documenting APIs and services:**
- List the service/API calls found in the code
- Document endpoints, HTTP methods, and parameters
- Describe request and response structures as they appear in the code
- Explain the purpose and context of each API call
- Note any error handling or retry logic
**When documenting components:**
- List inputs, outputs, and dependencies
- Explain initialization and lifecycle hooks
- Document key methods and their purpose
- Describe state management and data flow
- Note any important business logic or conditions

**When analyzing file dependencies:**
- Identify all import statements and what they import from
- Map out which files depend on which other files
- Note any external package dependencies
- Identify shared utilities or common modules used across multiple files
- Highlight the main entry points and how they connect to other modules
- Create a dependency flow showing how modules interact
- Note any potential issues like circular dependencies or tight coupling

## Analysis Approach:
- Analyze all provided code files thoroughly
- Map out the relationships and dependencies between files
- Extract the actual functionality, logic, and structure present
- Document what you find, not what you expect to find
- If information is incomplete, note what's present and what's missing
- Focus on understanding and explaining the code's purpose and behavior
- Pay special attention to how different files and modules work together

## Final Note:
Your goal is to create a clear, comprehensive technical specification that accurately reflects what's in the code. Be thorough, be accurate, and let the code guide your documentation structure.

USER_STORIES_TEMPLATE = """You are a Product Owner creating user stories from code.

Based on the following codebase context, create user stories:

{context}

{query}

## Your Task:
Analyze the provided code and extract user-facing functionality to create meaningful user stories. Focus on understanding what users can do with this application based on the actual code implementation.

## What to Extract:
- User interactions and workflows present in the code
- Features and capabilities available to users
- User roles and permissions (if present)
- Business rules and validation logic
- User interface elements and their purpose
- Data that users can view, create, update, or delete

## User Story Format:
For each piece of user-facing functionality found, create a user story using this format:

**As a** [type of user]  
**I want to** [perform some action]  
**So that** [I can achieve some goal]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [Additional criteria as needed]

## Guidelines:
- Base stories on actual functionality in the code, not assumptions
- Focus on user value and business outcomes
- Keep stories independent and testable
- Include relevant acceptance criteria from the code logic
- Group related stories by feature or workflow
- If user roles aren't explicit in the code, use generic "user" or infer from context

Generate user stories based on the actual code provided:
